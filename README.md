The user starts the game of Hangman: Candy Edition with 12 lifepoints, zero wins, and no wrong guesses. A candy-related word is randomly chosen from an array and is represented to the user with `__` for each letter of the word. The user guesses a letter by pressing a key on their keyboard. Every time the user guesses a letter, whether it is in the word or not, they lose a lifepoint. If the letter is in the word, it will take the place of the `__` where is it located in the word.
